## Installation

As on now, we do not have a CLI to install Ryuu's Monorepo. You can do either of the following:

### Use as Template

You can head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryuudotgg/monorepo) and create a new repository from the template.

### Clone the Repository

If you prefer to clone the repository, and update the remote manually, you can do so by running the following command:

<Tabs items={["HTTPS", "SSH", "GitHub CLI"]} persist defaultIndex={1}>
  <Tab value="HTTPS">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ryuudotgg/monorepo.git
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="SSH">
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ryuudotgg/monorepo.git
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="GitHub CLI">
    ```bash
    gh repo clone ryuudotgg/monorepo
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Environment Variables

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project before proceeding. You can read more about environment variables [here](/docs/env).

## Database

We'll assume you've created a database and set the correct environment variables. You will need to scaffold the database by running the migrations located in `packages/db/src/drizzle`:

<Tabs
  groupId="package-manager"
  items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}
   persist
  defaultIndex={1}
>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm --workspace db run migrate
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter db migrate
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn workspace db migrate
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun --filter db migrate
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Development

If you've set everything up correctly, you can run the development server by running the following command:

<Tabs
  groupId="package-manager"
  items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}
  persist
  defaultIndex={1}
>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Endpoints

You can find the applications running at the following endpoints:

- Web: http://localhost:3000
