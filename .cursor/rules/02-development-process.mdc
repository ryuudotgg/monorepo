# Development Process

When approaching any development task, follow these structured steps for consistent and high-quality results.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Request Analysis
- Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
- Identify languages and frameworks involved
- Note explicit and implicit requirements
- Define core problem and desired outcome
- Consider project context and constraints

### 2. Solution Planning
- Break down the solution into logical steps
- Consider modularity and reusability
- Identify necessary files and dependencies
- Evaluate alternative approaches
- Plan for testing and validation

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Choose appropriate design patterns
- Consider performance implications
- Plan for error handling and edge cases
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Verify best practices alignment

## Code Quality Standards

### General Requirements
- Comprehensive error handling
- Maintainable, self-documenting code
- Security best practices
- Proper type coverage
- ESLint and Prettier compliance
- Vitest for unit and integration testing

### Testing Approaches
- Plan for unit and integration tests
- Implement proper test coverage
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate accessibility compliance

> Prioritize clarity and maintainability while delivering robust, accessible, and performant solutions aligned with the latest React 19 and Next.js 15 features and best practices.
